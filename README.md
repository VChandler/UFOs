# UFOs
## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project is to provide an easily accessible, interactive view of data relating to UFO sightings throughout the country.  By making the data filterable, visitors to the site can examine the comments and various datapoints, and explore trends on their own terms. 

The webpage was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with some additional formatting from Bootstrap).

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
The new page has been designed for ease of use and for visual impact using dark elements.  Beyond the introductory article on the top half of the screen, the data and relevant filters are provided on the bottom half.

### Unfiltered by default
By default, the data is unsorted:

### Easy filter examples to follow
The filters will be blank, though they have an example of how to complete each item:

The filters have been built using JavaScript, providing an easy way to enter filter terms without the need to click a button.  By simply entering items in one or more fields, the page will automatically detect changes and apply the filter to the data accordingly:

## Summary
The new design is elegant and very easy to use.  However, one drawback is the lack of a way to visualize the data (for example, graphs of events based on filters).  This would enable more robust analysis of the data.

### Recommendations
For futher development, there are two recommendations:
* Adding an interactive graphing element to the page to visualize trends over time or geographically
* Collecting much more data. The timeframe of available data is minimal, and a bigger database of observations will result in more robust research by users.

With further development, this site can become a particularly userful resource to UFO enthusiasts around the world.
